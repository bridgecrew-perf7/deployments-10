### Explanation:

This way I decide on where to deploy my project is pretty simple. If it's a Gatsby project, it is deployed on Gatsby Cloud. If it is a React project, it's most likely going to be deployed on Cloudflare Pages. I deploy my pure HTML, CSS and JS projects on Render, though it can also deploy static react apps if needed. If I need the website to be fast, it is deployed on Vercel or Netlify. Finally, I use Github Pages for placeholder websites. There are exceptions to this such as my personal website, built with Gatsby is hosted on Netlify because I want it to load really fast and Jack Travels is hosted on Netlify because there is a 25mb limit and a video in the project is over that.

## Wordpress Websites

### Hosting Locations:

**A free-tier is provided for all the hosting services below.**

- [ProFreeHost](https://profreehost.com)
- [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net)
- [ByetHost](https://byet.host)

### Project And Deployment Location:


* [Jack Solutions](https://jacksolutions.ga) | ProFreeHost
* [Jack Technology (Redirects to Static Site)](https://jacktech.cf) | ProFreeHost

<br />

### Note:

Most of the Wordpress sites have been converted to static sites. For example, [Jack Solutions Wordpress](https://jacksolutions.ga) was converted to [Jack Solutions Static](https://jacksolutions.cf). The reason for this is the speed and security improvments that come with static sites. However, you do lose the dynamic functionality of Wordpress sites.
